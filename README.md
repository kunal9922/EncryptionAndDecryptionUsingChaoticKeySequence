# Encryption And Decryption Using Chaotic Key Sequence
## Overview
This project employs chaotic key sequences for encryption and decryption, enhancing cryptographic security. Chaotic systems generate random-like sequences used as keys to modify pixel values in images. By leveraging chaos theory, this method offers robust encryption.

## Methodology
* Encryption: Chaotic key sequences modify pixel values in images. These sequences, generated from chaotic systems, provide high unpredictability.

* Decryption: Decryption uses the same chaotic sequence by replicating initial conditions and control parameters. Applying reverse operations restores the original image.

## Security Advantage
Chaotic systems' sensitivity to initial conditions makes this encryption formidable. Even tiny deviations lead to vastly different sequences, rendering decryption challenging.

## Implementation
Web technologies power this project, ensuring cross-platform accessibility. Harnessing chaos theory, the project showcases the power of chaos in Cryptography.

## Run the project 
First of all, install Python dependencies 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Then Run the Flask server 
> python app.py

The project will be running on the Werkzeug server

## Explain the process of core key generation of encryption and decryption

Each pixel of an image gets many keys for encryption, that is why this algorithm is so robust for CryptoGraphy.

## Bifurcation Diagram
A bifurcation diagram illustrates the values that a system approaches asymptotically (fixed points, periodic orbits, or chaotic attractors) in relation to a bifurcation parameter within the system.

## Overview
A Bifurcation Diagram reveals how system stability can significantly depend on input factors.

## Calculation
The diagram is generated by iterating a given equation over a defined range of r values for a set number of iterations. The equation's results are then plotted, with each r on the x-axis and the corresponding x values on the y-axis.

The logistic map equation is used:
