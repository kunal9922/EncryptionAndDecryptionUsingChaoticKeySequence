# Encryption And Decryption Using ChaoticKeySequence
python based repo for Encryption and Decryption using advance crypto technic called Chaotic Key Sequence

The basic principle of encryption with chaos is based on the ability of some dynamic systems to produce sequence of numbers that are random in nature. This sequence is used to encrypt messages. For decryption, the sequence of random numbers is highly dependent on the initial condition used for generating this sequence. A very minute deviation in the initial condition will result in a totally different sequence. This sensitivity to initial condition makes chaotic systems ideal for encryption.

Every pixel of and image get key for encryption that's why this algo is so strong for CryptoGraphy.

# **Bifurcation diagram** 

a [**bifurcation diagram**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) the values visited or approached asymptotically (fixed points, [periodic orbits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_orbit), or [chaotic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(mathematics))[attractors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor)) of a system as a function of a [bifurcation parameter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory) in the system.

A [Bifurcation Diagram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram) shows that the stability of a system can be highly dependant on the inputs.

It is calculated by looping the folowing equation, for a number of iterations, and every `r` in a defined range. Then the results are plotted with each `r` on the x-axis, and `x` on the y-axis ![Logistic Map](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1d88296028cd6a06bd0007ca050d728e7da7447a)

Then the results are plotted with each `r` on the x-axis, and `x` on the y-axis, resulting in the following diagram.

* Minimum_r = 3.0
* Maximum_r = 4.0
* Max_itermations = 1000
* Skip_itermations = 100
* Step_r = 0.0001
